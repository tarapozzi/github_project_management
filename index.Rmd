## Why Github beyond R-DAVIS?

You've gotten familiar with the benefits of using Github already - keeping track of your work during this class, pushing your homeworks each week, downloading our tutorial scripts, etc. What about beyond this class? Github offers a flexible, collaborative, and free storage of your work that can be very helpful when you want to back up your work or share your files easily with a collaborator. For these reasons, this tutorial focuses on how to use Github for your future R projects!
